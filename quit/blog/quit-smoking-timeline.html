      <div class="article-body">
        <p>Deciding to quit smoking is the single best thing you can do for your health. But what exactly happens after you put out that last cigarette? The human body is incredibly resilient, and the healing process begins much faster than you might think.</p>
        
        <p>In fact, within just 20 minutes, your body starts to repair the damage caused by smoking. Here is the complete timeline of health benefits you can expect on your journey to becoming smoke-free.</p>

        <h2>The First 24 Hours: Immediate Relief</h2>
        <p>The earliest changes are often the most dramatic as your body purges the immediate toxins from cigarette smoke.</p>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <span class="timeline-time">20 Minutes</span>
          <strong>Heart Rate Stabilizes.</strong> Your pulse and blood pressure, which spike when you smoke, begin to drop back to normal levels. Your hands and feet may start to feel warmer as circulation improves.
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <span class="timeline-time">8 Hours</span>
          <strong>Nicotine Levels Fall.</strong> By now, the amount of nicotine in your bloodstream has fallen by more than 90%. While this is good for your health, it's also when early withdrawal symptoms might start.
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <span class="timeline-time">12 Hours</span>
          <strong>Oxygen Levels Reset.</strong> Carbon monoxide, a toxic gas from cigarette smoke, prevents oxygen from entering your lungs and blood. At 12 hours, carbon monoxide levels return to normal, and your blood oxygen levels increase significantly.
        </div>

        <h2>First Week: The Hardest Part</h2>
        <p>The first few days are often the most challenging physically, as your body adjusts to being nicotine-free. However, the biological repairs accelerating during this time are massive.</p>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <span class="timeline-time">48 Hours</span>
          <strong>Senses Return.</strong> Smoking damages the nerve endings in your nose and mouth. At two days smoke-free, you may notice that food tastes better and smells are more distinct as these nerves begin to heal.
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <span class="timeline-time">72 Hours</span>
          <strong>Breathing Eases.</strong> Your bronchial tubes begin to relax, making breathing feel easier. Your energy levels may also start to increase.
        </div>

        <div class="cta-box">

        <h2>Long-Term Recovery: reclaiming Your Health</h2>
        <p>As you move from weeks to months, the benefits compound. Your risk for serious diseases begins to drop significantly.</p>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <span class="timeline-time">1 Year</span>
          <strong>Heart Disease Risk Halved.</strong> Your risk of coronary heart disease is now half that of a smoker. This is a massive milestone for your long-term longevity.
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <span class="timeline-time">10 Years</span>
          <strong>Lung Health Restored.</strong> Your risk of lung cancer falls to about half that of a smoker. Pre-cancerous cells are replaced by healthy cells.
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <span class="timeline-time">15 Years</span>
          <strong>Full Recovery.</strong> Your risk of coronary heart disease is now the same as someone who has never smoked. Your body has effectively healed much of the long-term damage.
        </div>

        <h2>Stay Motivated</h2>
        <p>Knowing what comes next can be a powerful motivator. Every minute you stay smoke-free is a victory for your body. If you're struggling, remember that cravings typically last only 3-5 minutes. Breathe through them, and keep your eye on the next milestone.</p>
