Purposeful tools that help you quit smoking and protect your focus. Calm visuals, clear guidance, and data that stays personal.

## What we are shipping
- Stop Smoking app with milestones, craving logs, and gentle nudges.
- Focus tools on the way, built on the same calm principles.
- A clean landing site at [lotriflow.com](https://lotriflow.com) that mirrors the in-app experience.

## Quick links
- Live site: [lotriflow.com](https://lotriflow.com)
- Download: App Store listing (placeholder link in `index.html` until the listing is live)
- Say hello: [hello@lotriflow.com](mailto:hello@lotriflow.com)

## Local preview
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/lotriflow.git
cd lotriflow
# Open the landing page locally
start index.html
# Optional: optimize any new PNGs/JPEGs before committing
pwsh ./optimize_images.ps1
```

## Stack and structure
- Static site using HTML, CSS, and light vanilla JS for motion.
- Assets live in `images/`; styles in `css/style.css`; custom domain set via `CNAME`.
- `optimize_images.ps1` runs ImageMagick to keep assets small for GitHub Pages.

## Roadmap glimpses
- Swap the App Store placeholder with the live listing link.
- Add dedicated sections for focus tools once they ship.
- Publish a short changelog for site updates and product milestones.
