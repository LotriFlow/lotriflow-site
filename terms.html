      lotriflow SmokeFree is a personal tool designed to help users track their
      quit-smoking journey. It is not medical advice, treatment, or a guaranteed

    <h2>3. No Medical Advice</h2>
    <p>
      The App is for informational purposes only. It does not provide medical,
      psychological, or professional advice. Quitting smoking can have serious
      health implications. Consult a healthcare professional before making any
      changes to your health habits.
    </p>

    <h2>4. User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      You are solely responsible for your use of the App and any decisions
      related to quitting smoking. The App does not guarantee success, and
      results may vary. Use of the App is entirely at your own risk.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      lotriflow and its developers are not responsible for any loss, damage, or
      harm resulting from your use of the App, including but not limited to
      health issues, addiction relapse, or any other consequences. The App is
      provided "as is" without warranties of any kind.

    </p>

    <h2>7. In-App Purchases</h2>

      as required by applicable law or Apple's refund policies. Contact Apple 
      Support for refund requests.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Health Information Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      Health recovery timelines and milestones shown in the App are based on 
      general medical research and averages. Individual results vary significantly 
      based on smoking history, health conditions, and other factors. These 
      timelines are estimates for motivational purposes only and should not be 
      interpreted as personal medical predictions.
    </p>
